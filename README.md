## Introduction

The Net Practice project at 42 aims to equip students with fundamental networking skills by solving networking problems in a simulated environment. Students will configure small-scale networks, understand TCP/IP addressing, and troubleshoot various network issues.

### What is TCP/IP?

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. It defines how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

### Key Components of TCP/IP

1. **IP Address**: A unique identifier for each device on a network, allowing devices to locate and communicate with each other.
2. **Subnet Mask**: Defines the range of IP addresses that can be used within a network.
3. **Default Gateway**: The node that serves as an access point to another network, typically a router.

### How TCP/IP Works

1. **Data Transmission**: Data is broken into packets for transmission.
2. **Routing**: Routers direct packets to their destination based on IP addresses.
3. **Reassembly**: At the destination, packets are reassembled into the original data format.

### Connecting Devices

1. **Switch**: A networking device that connects devices within a local area network (LAN). It uses MAC addresses to forward data only to intended devices.
2. **Router**: Connects multiple networks and routes data between them. It uses IP addresses to determine the best path for data transfer.
3. **Internet**: A global network of interconnected computers and networks that communicate via TCP/IP.

### Steps to Connect Devices

- **Assign IP Addresses**: Each device must have a unique IP address.
- **Configure Subnet Masks**: Define the network segment for the devices.
- **Set Up Default Gateways**: Ensure devices can access external networks via a router.
